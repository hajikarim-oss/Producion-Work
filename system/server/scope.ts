// Row-level data scoping for the two-role system.
//
// The MASTER user sees every row; a TEAM_MEMBER sees only rows that belong to
// them. Ownership reaches every table through one of two shapes:
//
//   Campaign.userId / Mailbox.userId  — direct owner column
//   Lead                              — via its Campaign's owner
//   EmailEvent                        — via lead -> Campaign's owner
//   EmailMessage                      — via the sending mailbox's owner
//                                        (the row carries no lead or user link)
//
// Predicates are returned as SQL fragments so each caller can splice them into
// its existing WHERE/JOIN without reworking parameter indices. The user id is
// inlined as a quoted literal after a strict charset check (ids are Prisma
// cuids issued by the database, never user-supplied text), which keeps the
// many aggregate queries below free of extra $n bookkeeping.
