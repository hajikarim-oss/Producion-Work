// Engagement attribution

// EmailEvent only covers 15 historical rows, while the Smartlead webhook writes
// opens/replies/bounces straight onto the Lead row (openCount, totalReplied,
// lastContactedAt ...). Every engagement event therefore resolves to exactly one
// date per lead, in this priority order:
//   1. the lead's own timestamp (lastOpenAt / repliedAt / lastBouncedAt)
//   2. an EmailEvent row for that kind
//   3. an EmailMessage row flagged replied / bounced, matched by email
//   4. the send the lead belongs to (lastContactedAt) - webhook-stored opens of
//      a same-day batch land on the send date
//   5. updatedAt, only for leads that were never contacted (reply rows the
//      webhook wrote on their own)
// The bulk intelligence refresh (updatedAt) never wins over a real timestamp or
// a send, so no engagement is painted on a date it did not happen.
